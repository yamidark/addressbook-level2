== Apply Encapsulation `[LO-Encapsulation]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/objects/encapsulation/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Objects: Encapsulation]

=== Exercise: Encapsulate `CommandResult` class members

* A member of the `CommandResult` class is not encapsulated. i.e. it is visible outside the object.
Hide it so that it can only be accessed using methods provided.

'''''

== Implement a class `[LO-ImplementClass]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/classes/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Classes]

=== Exercise: Split `Address` into more classes

Side reading: https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/primitive-obsession[Code smell: Primitive Obsession] - A case against using primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks

* Assume the address is entered in the following format `a/BLOCK, STREET, UNIT, POSTAL_CODE`
e.g. `a/123, Clementi Ave 3, #12-34, 231534`
* Split the `Address` class as follows. Note: the filled diamond symbol â—† means an `Address` _consists of_ `Block`, `Street`, etc.
+

* Update the user guide and tests to match.

== Follow the Single Responsibility Principle `[LO-SRP]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/principles/singleResponsibilityPrinciple/[se-edu/se-book: Principles: Single Responsibility Principle]

=== Exercise: Split `TextUi` class

The exercise in the `LO-ImplementClass` section is somewhat related to SRP as well.
Here's a slightly more difficult exercise.

* `TextUi` class has more than one responsibility.
Try to extract out the responsibility of Formatting text for display (e.g. adding decorations) in to a
separate class named `Formatter`.

'''''

== Handle Exceptions `[LO-Exceptions]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/errorHandling/exceptions/[se-edu/se-book: Error Handling: Exceptions]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/exceptions/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: Exceptions]

=== Exercise: Handle 'file readonly' situation

* The current code does not handle the situation where the user accidentally makes the storage file _read only_ while the AddressBook program is running. Use exceptions to handle that situation better. e.g. instead of crashing, the program can inform the user of the problem.

'''''

== Use Inheritance to achieve code reuse `[LO-Inheritance]`

Note how the `Command` class contains some code that is reused by some of its child classes.
By defining `*Command` classes as child classes of `Command`, we have avoided having to duplicate those methods
in multiple `*Command` classes.

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/inheritance/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Inheritance]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/inheritance/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: Inheritance]

=== Exercise: Extract a `Contact` class

* Extract commonalities from `Phone`, `Email` and `Address` classes into a parent class called `Contact`.

== Follow Interface Segregation Principle `[LO-ISP]`

Note how the `Person` class implements the `ReadOnlyPerson` interface so that clients who don't need write access to
`Person` objects can access `Person` objects through the `ReadOnlyPerson` interface instead.

image::ReadOnlyPersonUsage.png[width=600]

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/principles/interfaceSegregationPrinciple/[se-edu/se-book: Principles: Interface Segregation Principle]

=== Exercise: Add a `Printable` interface

* Add a `Printable` interface as follows.
+
image::PrintableInterface.png[width=400]
* `Override` the `getPrintableString` in classes `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, and `Address` so that each produces a printable
string representation of the object. e.g. `Name: John Smith`, `Phone: 12349862`
* Add the following method in a suitable place of some other class.
Note how the method depends on the Interface.
+
[source,java]
----
/**
  * Returns a concatenated version of the printable strings of each object.
  */
String getPrintableString(Printable... printables){
----
+
The above method can be used to get a printable string representing a bunch of person details.
For example, you should be able to call that method like this:
+
[source,java]
----
//p is a Person object
return getPrintableString(p.getPhone(), p.getEmail(), p.getAddress()); 
----

'''''

== Use class-level members `[LO-ClassLevel]`

Note how some of the variables and methods are declared `static`. That means they are _class-level_ members
rather than _instance-level_ members.
e.g. `Main.VERSION`, `Name.EXAMPLE`, `Utils.isAnyNull(...)`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/classes/classLevelMembers/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Classes: Class-Level Members]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/classes/classLevelMembers/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: Classes: Class-Level Members]

=== Exercise: Add class-level members

* Convert the `Parser::parseCommand(...)` method (i.e. the `parseCommand()` method of the `Parser` class) to a
class-level method. Note how this method can be either class-level or instance-level.
* Note how some instance-level methods, such as the `setTags` method of the `Person` class, cannot be converted to a class-level method.
* Add an instance-level member `int sequenceNumber` and a class-level variable `int nextSequenceNumber`
to the `Person` class. Using these two variables, ensure that each `Person` object has a unique sequence number
that indicates the order in which `Person` objects were created. e.g.
** `Adam` is the first `Person` object to be created. It is assigned sequence number 1.
** `Ben` and `Charlie` are created next, and assigned 2 and 3 respectively.
** `Ben` is deleted.
** `Daisy` is added next and is given sequence number 4.

== Use Composition `[LO-Composition]`

Note the following examples of _composition_ (filled diamond):

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=================================================
|Whole |Parts
|`AddressBook` |`UniquePersonList`
|`Person` |`Name` `Phone` `Email` `Address` `Tag`
|=================================================

Contrast with these examples of _aggregration_ (empty diamond):

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|============================
|Container |Contained
|`UniquePersonList` |`Person`
|============================

== Use Association Classes `[LO-AssociationClass]`

The current design does not have any association classes.

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/associations/associationClasses/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Associations: Association Classes]

=== Exercise: Add an Association Class `Tagging`

* Assume the following:
. There are commands to add and remove tags to a person in the address book.
. When the AddressBook program exits, it should print out a list of all the tags added/deleted during that session.
e.g.
+
[source]
----
+ Jake Woo [friend]
- Jake Woo [colleague]
+ Jean Wong [client]
----
* To support (ii) above, implement an Association Class called `Tagging` as given in the diagram below.
Each `Tagging` object will represent an adding or deleting of a tag for a specific person that happened
during that session.
+
image::TaggingClass.png[width=400]
+
[NOTE]
====
Note that if the list of ``Tagging``'s is kept as a class-level variable in the `Tagging` class,
the diagram would be like this:

== Use JUnit to implement unit tests `[LO-JUnit]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/junit/[se-edu/se-book: JUnit]

Note how there are many test classes in this code base that uses JUnit to implement automated unit tests e.g. link:{repoURL}/test/java/seedu/addressbook/parser/ParserTest.java[`test/java/seedu/addressbook/parser/ParserTest.java`] class contains tests for the link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/parser/Parser.java[`seedu.addressbook.parser.Parser`] class.

=== Exercise: Write unit tests for the `Utils#isAnyNull(Object...)` method

* First, make sure you know how to run JUnit tests by running existing JUnit tests.
Instructions are in the <<DeveloperGuide#junit-tests, Developer Guide>>.
* Next, add a test to link:{repoURL}/test/java/seedu/addressbook/common/UtilsTest.java[`test/seedu/addressbook/common/UtilsTest.java`] to test the link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/common/Utils.java#L15[`seedu.addressbook.common.Utils#isAnyNull(Object...)`] method.

== Use TDD `[LO-TDD]`

It's recommended you do `[LO-JUnit]` before attempting TDD.

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testing/tdd/[se-edu/se-book: Quality Assurance: Testing: TDD]

=== Exercise: Add a method in TDD fashion

* Add the following method to the `Name` class. Use the TDD technique to add the method. Commit after each step.
+
[source,java]
----
/**
  * Returns true if the other name is very similar to this name.
  * Two names are considered similar if ...
  */
  public boolean isSimilar(Name other) { ... }
----
* You may define 'similar' as you see fit.
Make sure the definition covers scenarios where other name is `null`, in a different case, in a different order,
is a subset/superset, etc.
e.g. `John K Smith` `John K SMITh` `John Smith` `Smith, John K`
* Don't forget to refactor the method to improve its code quality at the end.

== Work in a 2KLoC code base `[LO-2KLoC]`

=== Exercise: Enhance AddressBook

Add a feature to AddressBook. Here are some suggestions.

* An Edit command
* A Sort command
* List all persons automatically after an add or delete command
* Any other enhancement that you might see fit
